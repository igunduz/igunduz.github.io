## Compgen2021: Hands-on Course on Machine Learning for Genomics


As the teaching assistant of this course, I prepared the course material and assist the participants. I also wrote benchmark machine learning models for the capstone project of this course.

General Info
======

The general aim of the course is to equip participants with practical and
technical knowledge to deploy machine learning methods on genomic data sets.
With this aim in mind, we will go through certain statistical concepts and move
on to unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods to analyze
high-dimensional data sets.

The course will be beneficial for first year computational biology PhD students,
and experimental biologists and medical scientists who want to begin data
analysis or are seeking a better understanding of computational genomics and
analysis of popular sequencing methods. The course is open for anyone who is
interested in the subjects we are teaching.

Learning Objectives
======

**Module 1:** *Statistics for genomics (2-8 August 2021)*

* A simple intro to statistical distributions hypothesis testing linear models.

**Module 2:** *Unsupervised learning for genomics (9-15 August 2021)*

* Understanding basic intuition behind machine learning approaches. 
* Using unsupervised learning to cluster and visualise data points
* Dimension reduction techniques for visualisation and as input to clustering
methods

**Module 3:** *Supervised learning for genomics (16-22 August 2021)*
* Understanding and using supervised learning methods for predictive purposes
* How to measure prediction performance
* Understand and use cross-validation and related concepts

**Module 4:** *Capstone Project (23 August - 5 September 2021)*
* The questions and prepared datasets will be provided by the instruction team. 
* The main theme of the tasks in the capstone project will revolve around
prediction of drug response using genomic data sets.
