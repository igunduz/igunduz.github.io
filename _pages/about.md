I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/department/department-of-computer-science.html) in the lab of [Prof.Fabian MULLER](https://icb.uni-saarland.de/people/fabian-muller/) also known as, [Integrative Cellular Biology and Bioinformatics Laboratory.](https://icb.uni-saarland.de/)


Also, I am currently working as a rotation student in the [Chair of Clinical Bioinformatics](https://www.ccb.uni-saarland.de/) led by [Prof. Andreas Keller.](https://www.ccb.uni-saarland.de/people/prof-dr-andreas-keller/)


I always enjoyed figuring out how something works, why it breaks, and how to fix it. I focused on bioinformatics to explore the world of biology and learn how to use biological information to develop a better understanding of developmental systems and, diseases.Through my experiences, I have seen that the future of biology involves cell-type-specific investigations. This has now become the basis of my long-term research passion for single-cell bioinformatics.

I use interpretable machine learning models and, computational epigenomics to enlight cellular state and, regulatory dynamics in developmental systems as well as in diseases. My research interests can be summarized as, but are not limited to:

*  Trustworthy Machine Learning Applications for Biology
*  Graph Neural Networks
*  Genome Regulation
*  Ageing Biology 
*  Single-Cell Multi-Omics
*  Cell Fate Decisions
*  Software Development for Bioinformatics


I'm an active member of [Bioinformatics Research Network.](https://www.bio-net.dev/) I voluntarely work as a skill assesment reviewer where as a part of the team, I assest coding skills of [BRN](https://www.bio-net.dev/) trainees in terms of code efficiency and, cleanless. I also run an ageing journal club, where we share and, discuss latest articles on ageing.

If you are interested in one of those topics, join the ageing journal club, or want to learn more about [BRN](https://www.bio-net.dev/), you know how to reach me! :)
