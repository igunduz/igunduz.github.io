I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at [Saarland University.](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/department/department-of-computer-science.html) I am currently working as a rotation studdent in the [Integrative Cellular Biology and Bioinformatics laboratory](https://icb.uni-saarland.de/) led by [Prof. Fabian Muller.](https://icb.uni-saarland.de/people/fabian-muller/)

I always enjoyed figuring out how something works, why it breaks, and how to fix it. I use bioinformatics and computational epigenomics to develop a better understanding of cellular regulatory dynamics and cell state in developmental systems as well as in diseases.

My research interests can be summarized as but are not limited to:

*  Computational epigenomics
*  Applied machine learning 
*  Aging biology 
*  Chromatin biology 
*  Single-cell technology
*  Developmental and disease biology
*  Software development for bioinformatics


I'm also an active member of [Bioinformatics Research Network.](https://www.bio-net.dev/) I voluntarely work as a skill assesment reviewer where as a part of the team, I assest coding skills of [BRN](https://www.bio-net.dev/) trainees in terms of code efficiency and, cleanless.

If you're interested in one of those topics or want to learn about [BRN](https://www.bio-net.dev/), you know how to reach me!
