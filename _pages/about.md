*Merhaba!* *Hi!* *Hallo!*  *Bonjour!*


I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at [Saarland University.](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/department/department-of-computer-science.html)
I am currently working in the [Integrative Cellular Biology and Bioinformatics laboratory](https://icb.uni-saarland.de/) led by [Prof. Fabian Muller.](https://icb.uni-saarland.de/people/fabian-muller/) as a rotation student.

I always enjoyed figuring out how something works, why it breaks, and how to fix
it. I discovered the world of epigenetics during my undergraduate studies and,
soon it imbued my interest.

I use bioinformatics and computational epigenomics to develop a better
understanding of cellular regulatory dynamics and cell state in developmental
systems as well as in diseases.

My interested can be summarized but not limited to:

*  Computational epigenomics
*  Applied machine learning 
*  Chromatin biology 
*  Single-cell technology
*  Developmental and disease biology


I'm also an active member of [Bioinformatics Research Network.](https://www.bio-net.dev/)
I voluntarely work as a skill assesment reviewer where as a part of the team, I
assest coding skills of [BRN](https://www.bio-net.dev/) trainees in terms of
code efficiency and, cleanless.
