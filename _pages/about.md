I'm a PhD candidate in [Integrative Cellular Biology and Bioinformatics Laboratory](https://icb.uni-saarland.de/) at Saarland University.

My research focuses on development of interpretable and explainable predictive models to model cell-type-specific gene regulation using multi-omics data. My research interests can be summarized as, but are not limited to:

*  Explainable Machine Learning 
*  Graph Neural Networks
*  Causal Gene Regulation
*  Ageing Biology 
*  Software Development for Bioinformatics


I'm also an active member of [Bioinformatics Research Network.](https://www.bio-net.dev/) I voluntarily work as a skill assessment reviewer whereas as part of the team, I assess the coding skills of [BRN](https://www.bio-net.dev/) trainees in terms of code efficiency and, cleanliness.
