I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/department/department-of-computer-science.html) in the lab of [Prof.Fabian MULLER](https://icb.uni-saarland.de/people/fabian-muller/) also known as, [Integrative Cellular Biology and Bioinformatics Laboratory.](https://icb.uni-saarland.de/)


Also, I am currently working as a rotation student in the [Chair of Clinical Bioinformatics](https://www.ccb.uni-saarland.de/) led by [Prof. Andreas Keller.](https://www.ccb.uni-saarland.de/people/prof-dr-andreas-keller/)


I always enjoyed figuring out how something works, why it breaks, and how to fix it. I focused on bioinformatics to explore the world of biology and learn how to use biological information to improve lives. Through those experiences, I have seen that the future of biology involves cell-type-specific investigations to detect the molecular changes that lead to diseases. This has now become the basis of my long-term research passion for single-cell bioinformatics. I use bioinformatics and computational epigenomics to develop a better understanding of cellular regulatory dynamics and cell state in developmental systems as well as in diseases. My research interests can be summarized as, but are not limited to:

*  Trustworthy Machine Learning 
*  Graph Neural Networks
*  Computational epigenomics
*  Genome Regulation
*  Aging Biology 
*  Single-Cell Technologies
*  Regulation of Cell Fate Decisions
*  Software Development for Bioinformatics


I'm also an active member of [Bioinformatics Research Network.](https://www.bio-net.dev/) I voluntarely work as a skill assesment reviewer where as a part of the team, I assest coding skills of [BRN](https://www.bio-net.dev/) trainees in terms of code efficiency and, cleanless.

If you're interested in one of those topics or want to learn about [BRN](https://www.bio-net.dev/), you know how to reach me!
