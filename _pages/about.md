Welcome! I'm İrem. I earned my B.Eng degree in Bioengineering from [Marmara University.](http://bioe.eng.marmara.edu.tr/en) Now, I'm a graduate student in Computer Science at [Saarland University.](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/department/department-of-computer-science.html) I am currently working in the [Integrative Cellular Biology and Bioinformatics laboratory](https://icb.uni-saarland.de/) led by [Prof. Fabian Müller.](https://icb.uni-saarland.de/people/fabian-muller/)


My Research Interest
----

I always enjoyed figuring out how something works, why it breaks, and how to fix
it. I studied bioengineering to explore the world of biology and learn how to
engineer it to improve lives.  Through my experiences, I have seen that the
future of biology involves the application of computational methods. This has
now become the basis of my long-term research passion for bioinformatics.
